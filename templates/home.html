    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
        The <strong>National Basketball Association (NBA)</strong> stands as the pinnacle of professional basketball, a league that has grown from humble beginnings into a global sporting powerhouse. Founded on <strong>June 6, 1946</strong>, as the <strong>Basketball Association of America (BAA)</strong>, the NBA as we know it emerged in <strong>1949</strong> after a merger with its rival, the <strong>National Basketball League (NBL)</strong>.
      </p>
    
      <h2>Early Days and Evolution</h2>
      <p>
        In the league’s early years, basketball was largely a regional attraction, played in smaller arenas with modest fanfare. Teams like the <strong>Minneapolis Lakers</strong>, led by big man <strong>George Mikan</strong>, were among the first dynasties. The 1950s and 60s saw the rise of <strong>Bill Russell</strong> and the <strong>Boston Celtics</strong>, who dominated the era with an unprecedented 11 championships in 13 seasons under coach <strong>Red Auerbach</strong>.
      </p>
    
      <h2>The Era of Superstars</h2>
      <p>
        The 1980s were transformative for the NBA. Rivalries like <strong>Magic Johnson’s Lakers vs. Larry Bird’s Celtics</strong> captivated national audiences and helped grow the sport’s popularity. This era laid the foundation for the global explosion that would follow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then came <strong>Michael Jordan</strong>, whose iconic tenure with the <strong>Chicago Bulls</strong> in the 1990s redefined superstardom and helped globalize the game. The Bulls’ six championships and Jordan’s fierce competitiveness became the gold standard of greatness.
      </p>
    
      <h2>Global Expansion and Modern NBA</h2>
      <p>
        By the 2000s, the NBA had gone global. Players like <strong>Dirk Nowitzki</strong>, <strong>Yao Ming</strong>, and <strong>Manu Ginóbili</strong> brought international talent and fanbases, while stars like <strong>Kobe Bryant</strong>, <strong>Shaquille O’Neal</strong>, and <strong>Tim Duncan</strong> carried the league forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        The modern NBA, led by stars such as <strong>LeBron James</strong>, <strong>Stephen Curry</strong>, <strong>Kevin Durant</strong>, and <strong>Giannis Antetokounmpo</strong>, blends athleticism, analytics, and global media presence. Innovations in technology and social media have further expanded the league’s reach.
      </p>
    
      <h2>Cultural Impact</h2>
      <p>
        More than just a sport, the NBA has become a cultural phenomenon. It has influenced music, fashion, and social justice movements. The league has often been at the forefront of activism, with players using their platforms to address important issues beyond the court.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        From dusty gyms to sold-out arenas across the world, the NBA’s journey has been one of growth, resilience, and spectacular talent. As the league continues to evolve, it remains a showcase of basketball brilliance and a reflection of global culture.
